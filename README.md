We would like to investigate the answer by evaluating how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform when applied to graphical perception tasks.

## How to answer this question?
To answer this research question, our study evaluates MLLMs' performance on graphical perception, inspired by two popular studies from Cleveland and McGrill, and Haehn et al. We incorporate our pretrained and fine-tuned MLLMs into our experiments. In particular, we compress fine-tuned models by training them on top of pretrained models, digging deep into their performance using efficient training configurations and scalable adaptation techniques to improve efficiency and save resources.

## Quick Intro
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have remarkably progressed in analyzing and understanding images. Despite these advancements, accurately regressing values in charts remains an underexplored area for MLLMs.

## What are our pretrained MLLMs?
We used the latest Multimodal Large Language Models technology, such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini Pro Vision, and Llama 3.2B Vision.

## What are our finetuned MLLMs?
We also produced 15 fine-tuned MLLMs (each experiment has three fine-tuned MLLMs) for this study, and built on top of Llama 3.2 Vision.

## ðŸŸ¢ What is our direction for this study?
Our study compares the performance of fine-tuned and pretrained models to see which models perform better. We also desire to understand where aspects of MLLMs succeed or fail in the data visualization fields.

We recreated stimuli for five experiments based on Cleveland and McGillâ€™s foundational 1984 study, comparing those results with human task performance.

## What are the special features of our study?
We integrated the most advanced packages into our study:
- Pytorch
- Pytorch Lighting
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Distributed Data Parallel
- Vision Encoder-Decoder Models
- Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning
- Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models
- Bits-per-Bite

We also designed a comprehensive script, and everything in one place, starting from generating datasets, fine-tuned models, and evaluating their MLLMs performances to interpret and analyze visual data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
You'll need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pip
- Conda

### Setup
After you forked and cloned our project into your repo, we recommend using Conda to set up a new environment:

```bash
conda env create -f conda-environment.yml
pip install -r pip-requirements.txt
```

After installing all packages and dependencies:

1. Navigate to the LLMP directory:
```bash
cd LLMP
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
```
chatgpt_api_key="add your API key"
gemini_api_key="add your API key"
```

3. Navigate to the experiment directory:
```bash
cd LLMP/EXP/EXP1
```

4. Run the experiment:
```bash
python EXP1fullprogressrun.py
```

We use Experiment 1 for this demonstration.
